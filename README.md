# Timeseries_with_ML


• This project aims to determine the Carbon Monoxide concentration in the air and the Temperature for next 24 hours of a certain place based on the previous data available to us.

• The data was first cleaned and converted to a useful format by using inbuilt functions of different data types in Python.


• Then, the anomalous data point were replaced and corrected by simple linear interpolation.


• After that, Exploratory Data Analysis was done to know more about the data and perform appropriate feature engineering accordingly.


• In order to get as high accuracy as possible, different kind of approaches, algorithms and neural networks were tried out.


• After comparing different models, using Boosting type Machine Learning algorithms like Xgboost along with proper feature engineering gave the optimal results and were used for predictions.
